#### 1.1 Focus Area :
1. Reinforce theoretical concept
2. Instrumentation and Practical Skills

#### 1.2 About the Experiment
<br/>
. To teach the basics of constructor and inheritance using an interactive simulator.<br>
. The purpose of the Virtual lab is to create interest in students to conduct new exper-iments in various disciplines.<br>
. With the help of our virtual lab, students get a chance to learn different aspects of Python programming language by getting to understand the concepts of built-in modules.<br>
. There might be some users who have a problem of understanding the use of con-structor and inheritance with just the theory in hand. With the simulator, it becomes easy to understand.<br>

#### 2. Instructional Strategy
Method  | Assessment | Instructional Strategy
:--|:--|:-:
Summative Assessment | 1. The main objective to develop this lab is to provide an interactive source of learning for the students. The simulation that we provide fulfills our purpose.<br>2. The learner will be easily able to understand Python programming language.<br>3. The user will able to understand the use of constructor and inheritance.<br>4. With the help of our virtual lab, students get a chance to learn Python programming language as they are provided with an interactive simulator. It is beneficial in understanding the basics of constructor and inheritance which simply cannot be understood by self- evaluation.	| Problem Based

#### 3 Task & Assessment Questions:
<br>


LO ID |    Learning Objective  | Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
591 | Student will be able to dene the concepts of constructor and inheritance in Python programming language. | To state the use of constructor and inheritance. | What is constructor? <br>What is inheritance?<br>
592 | Student will be able to describe the concepts of constructor and inheritance in Python programming language. | To understand the use of constructor and inheritance. | Why are constructors used? 
593 | Student will be able to apply constructor and inheritance in various Python programs. | To apply/use constructor and inheritance in various Python programs. | What is the use of <br>‘__ init __’ method?<br>

Sr No. |	What students will do?	|  What simulator will do? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Examine the simulator screen and take note of all the instructions. | Display all the simulator contents.  <div align="justify"> Display simulator in-terface.<br> 
2.| Press “Start” button |  Display the code in Python program-ming language. <div align="justify">To present a code to the user for better un-derstanding. <br> 
3.| Press “Next” button. |  Highlight each executing line and its output. <div align="justify">To explain the meaning of each line of code. <br> 
4.| Press “Reset" button. | Reset the simulator for a fresh start.  <div align="justify">To perform a fresh ex-periment. <br> 
5.| Press “Quiz” tab. | Display the quiz questions.  <div align="justify">To perform an evalua-tion of the knowledge gained by the user. <br>
