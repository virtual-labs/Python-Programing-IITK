## Theory

Inheritance is a feature that says if you define a new class giving a reference of some other class then due to inheriting property of python your new class will inherit all attributes and behavior of the parent class.
A Constructor is a special kind of method that have same name as the class in python self variable do the same. It can be used to set the values of the members of an object.

How to define constructor
Syntax:
class class_name
def __init__(self,variable1,variable2)
self.variabl1=variable1
self.variable2=variable2How to give values to objects using constructors
<br>
Syntax:
Object_name=class_name('variable values',variable values)How to call objects using constructors
<br>
Syntax:
print(Object_name.variable1)
Output: variable value.How to inherit a class
<br>
Syntax:
class class_name(parent class name)How to check whether it is inherited or not
<br>
Syntax:
Object_name = inherited_class_name('variable1,variable2')
print(Object_name.variable1)
Output: variable value.
