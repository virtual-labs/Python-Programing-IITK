#### 1.1 Focus Area : 
Sr No. |  Focus Area
:--|:--|
1. | Reinforce theoretical concept
2. | Instrumentation and Practical Skill

#### 1.2 About the Experiment
<br/>
. To teach the basic data types of python using an interactive simulator.<br>
. The purpose of the Virtual lab is to create interest in students to conduct new exper-iments in various disciplines.<br>
. With the help of our virtual lab, students get a chance to learn different aspects of Python programming language by getting to understand the concepts of data types.<br>
. There might be some users who have a problem of understanding the use of data types with just the theory in hand. With the simulator, it becomes easy to under-stand.<br>


#### 1.3 Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr No. | LO ID |   Learning Objective  | Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| 595 | Student will be able to describe the concepts of data types in Python programming language. | Understand | Describe
2.| 596 | Student will be able to describe the types of data types in Python programming language. | Understand | Describe
3.| 597 | Student will be able to apply data types in various Python Programs. | Apply | Apply

<h3> 2 Instructional Strategy</h3>

Method  | Assessment | Instructional Strategy
:--|:--|:-:
Summative Assessment | 1. The main objective to develop this lab is to provide an interactive source of learning for the students. The simulation that we provide fulfills our purpose.<br>2. The learner will be easily able to understand Python programming language.<br>3. The user will able to understand the use of data types in Python programming lan-guage.<br>4. With the help of our virtual lab, students get a chance to learn Python programming language as they are provided with an interactive simulator. It is beneficial in un-derstanding the basics of data types which simply cannot be understood by self-evaluation.<br> | Problem Based

#### 3 Task & Assessment Questions:
<br>

LO ID |    Learning Objective  | Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
595 |  Student will be able to describe the concepts of data types in Python programming language. | To State the use of data types. | What are data types in Python programming language?
596 | Student will be able to describe the types of data types in Python programming language. | To understand the use of data types | Why are data types used?
597 | Student will be able to apply data types in various Python Programs.  | To apply/use data types in various Python programs | What is the use of "list" data type?
598 | | to evaluate his knowledge on the basis of quiz questions |  In quiz section there are 3 levels to which user can attempt according to the time he have given in experiment to analyze and learn from it.

<br>

Sr No. |	What students will do?	|  What simulator will do? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| 1.  Examine the simulator screen and take note of all the instructions. <br>2.  Select the type of data types you want to use. <br> 3.  Enter input values if required. <br>4. Press “Start” button <br>5. Press “Next” button. <br>6. Pres “Reset" button.<br> 7. Press “Quiz” tab. | 1.  Display all the simulator contents.<br>2.  Bring the selected data type for use.<br>3. Input elds will take input if necessary.<br>4.  Display the code in Python programming language.<br> 5.  Highlight each executing line and its output.<br> 6. Reset the simulator for a fresh start.<br>7.  Display the quiz questions. | 1.  Display simulator interface.<br> 2.  To select a data type for performing the experiment.<br>3.  To take in input values to perform any operation.<br>4. To present a code to the user for better understanding. <br>5.  To explain the meaning of each line of code.<br>6. To perform a fresh experiment.<br>7.  To perform an evaluation of the knowledge gained by the user.
