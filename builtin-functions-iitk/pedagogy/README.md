#### 1.1 Focus Area : 
Sr No. |  Focus Area
:--|:--|
1. | Reinforce theoretical concept


#### 1.2 About the Experiment

<br/>1. To teach the basics of Functions using an interactive simulator.
<br/>2. The purpose of the Virtual lab is to create interest in students to conduct new experiments in various disciplines.
<br/>3. With the help of our virtual lab, students get a chance to learn different aspects of Python programming language by getting to understand the concepts of Functions.
<br/>4. There might be some users who have a problem of understanding the use of Functions with just the theory in hand. With the simulator, it becomes easy to understand.

#### 1.3 Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr No. |  LO ID |    Learning Objective  | Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| 603 | Student will be able to recall the concepts of Functions in Python programming language. | Remember   | Recall
2.| 604 | Student will be able to describe the use of Functions in Python programming language. | Understand| Describe

<h3> 2 Instructional Strategy</h3>

Method  | Assessment | Instructional Strategy
:--|:--|:-:
Summative Assessment | 1·  The main objective to develop this lab is to provide an interactive source of learning for the students. The simulation that we provide fulfil our purpose <br>2· The learner will be easily able to understand Python programming language.<br>3·  The user will able to understand the use of Functions.<br>4· With the help of our virtual lab, students get a chance to learn Python programming language as they are provided with an interactive simulator. It is beneficial in understanding the basics of Functions which simply cannot be understood by self-evaluation. | Expository

<br>

LO ID |    Learning Objective  | Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
603 | Student will be able to recall the concepts of Functions in Python programming language | Student will select functions from the dropdown | Which of the following is not function in python?  <br> <b>A. type(A)</b> <br> B. Types(A) <br> C. TypeOf(A) <br> D.None of these
604 | Student will be able to describe the use of Functions in Python programming language. | Student will click on next button and see the line by line execution. | What is the use of function id(object) ? <br><b> A. to return the identity of an object.</b> <br> B. to return the type of object <br> C. to return the memory location of object <br>D. None Of These

#### 4. Simulator Interactions :

<br>Complete the following table giving the details of the Simulator interactions.
What Simulator will do? What students will do? Purpose of the task

| Sr No. | What students will do| What simulator will do | Purpose of the task  |
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.|Examine the simulator screen and take note of all the instructions.  | Display all the simulator contents.| For understanding the basic instructions|
2.|Press “Start” button|Display code in Python programming language.| To present a code to the user for better understanding.|
3.|Press “Function by type” button|switch to type function simulator| To let the students know about the type function in python|
4.|Press “Execute” button| show the excecution of function line by line|To explain the meaning of each line of code|
5.|Press “Reset" button.|Reset the simulator to start from beginning|To perform a fresh experiment|
