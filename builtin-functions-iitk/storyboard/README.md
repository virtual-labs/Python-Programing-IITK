## Round 2

Experiment 2: Functions

### 1. Story Outline:

<div align="justify"> The experiment involves the use of python simulator implementing various in-built functions in python programming. An executable program may contain many lines which occupies more memory. This difficulty can be countered with the help of python in-built functions that save sour time and memory. Python simulator provides a programming environment to the beginners, so that every new user can easily implement in-built functions in various python programs.

### 2. Story:

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
<h2>Construction of the set-up</h2>

For better visualization, a simulator is provided. A simulation can always act as the best possible alternative to learn. the simulator is divided into three sections: <br>
➢	Input Section: Helps in interacting with the user (accepting function-name and return-type as inputs).<br>
➢	Code Section: Displays the subsequent function module or code for each type of choice the user takes to implement functions.<br>
➢	Output Section: Displays the output that will be generated after the code runs successfully.

#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>understand the pre-defined or built-in functions used in python programming language | Understand | Describe
2.| User will be able to: <br>use the simulator as a Python interpreter.  | Understand| Describe
3.| User will be able to: <br>enter function-name and id to perform a particular task. | Apply | Implement
4.| User will be able to: <br>generate the desired output of the previous inputs. | Analyze| Examine

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

The simulator tab would allow:<br> <br>
<dd> 1. The setup consists of a simulator that helps in implementing functions in python programming language with the use of interpreter.<br>
2. Additionally, there will be three sections to work upon: Input Section, Code Section and Output Section. <br>
3. The code section will display the python code for the type of function you want to implement.<br>
4. Once the experiment has been performed, you can take the quiz.

##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

Assessment Questions:<br>

<dd><b> 1. What will the function id() return?<br>
a.	Integer Value<br>
b.	Character<br>
c.	String<br>
d.	All of the Above<br></dd><br></b><br>
<dd><b>2. Which of the following keywords make the begining of the function block?<br>
a.	fun<br>
b.	define<br>
c.	def<br>
d.	function
<br><br></b>
<dd>
<b> 3. Which of the following items are present in the function header?<br>
a)	Function name<br>
b)	Parameter list<br>
c)	Return type<br>
d)	Both a & b<br></b>
</dd>
<dd>
<b>4.	What is the output of the following code? <br>
N=1
def func():
     N=3
     print(N)
func()
print(n)
a)	1 3<br>
b)	3 3<br>
c)	3 1<br>
d)	Runtime Error<br></b>
</dd>




##### 2.6 Conclusion:
<dd>The python interpreter has a number of in-built or pre-defined functions. They are loaded automatically as the interpreter starts and are always available. Thus, it makes it easier for a programmer to implement functions and perform complex tasks with ease.
