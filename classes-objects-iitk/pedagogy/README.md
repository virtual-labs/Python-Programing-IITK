#### 1.1 Focus Area : 
1. Reinforce theoretical concept
2. Instrumentation and Practical Skills

#### 1.2 About the Experiment
<br/>
. To teach the basics of classes and objects using an interactive simulator.<br>
. The purpose of the Virtual lab is to create interest in students to conduct new experiments in various disciplines.<br>
. With the help of our virtual lab, students get a chance to learn different aspects of Python programming language by getting to understand the concepts of classes and objects.<br>
. There might be some users who have a problem of understanding the use of classes and objects with just the theory in hand. With the simulator, it becomes easy to un-derstand.<br>


#### 1.3 Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr No. |  LO ID |    Learning Objective  | Cognitive Level | Action Verb

#### 2. Instructional Strategy


Method  | Assessment | Instructional Strategy
:--|:--|:-:
Summative Assessment | 1. The main objective to develop this lab is to provide an interactive source of learning for the students. The simulation that we provide fulfills our purpose. <br>2. The learner will be easily able to understand Python programming language. <br>3. The user will able to understand the use of classes and objects.<br>4. With the help of our virtual lab, students get a chance to learn Python programming language as they are provided with an interactive simulator. It is beneficial in understanding the basics of classes and objects which simply cannot be understood by self-evaluation.	| Problem Based

Sr No. |	What students will do?	|  What simulator will do? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Examine the simulator screen and take note of all the instructions. | Display all the simulator contents. | <div align="justify"> Display simulator interface.<br> 
2.| Press “Start” button | Display the code in Python program-ming language. |<div align="justify"> To present a code to the user for better understanding. <br> 
3.| Press “Next” button. | Highlight each executing line and its output. |<div align="justify"> To explain the meaning of each line of code. <br>
4.| Press “Reset" button. | Reset the simulator for a fresh start. |<div align="justify"> To perform a fresh ex-periment. <br>
5.| Press “Quiz” tab. | Display the quiz questions. |<div align="justify"> To perform an evalua-tion of the knowledge gained by the user. <br>
