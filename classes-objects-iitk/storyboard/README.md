## Round 2

Experiment 6: : Class and Objects

### 1. Story Outline:

<div align="justify"> Here, the experiment involves the use of python simulator for implementing class and objects related operations. Python has been an object-oriented language since it existed. Because of this, creating and using classes and objects are downright easy. This concept can be countered with the help of python simulator that provides a friendly programming environment to the beginners; so that every new user can easily perform operations related to class and objects .

### 2. Story:

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:

<h2>Construction of the Set-up</h2>

For better visualization, a simulator is divided into three aections. <br>
➢ Input Section: Helps in interacting with the user (accepting numbers as inputs).<br>
➢ Code Section: Displays the subsequent code for each type of choice the user takes to perform any operation.<br>
➢ Output Section: Displays the output that will be generated after the code runs successfully.

#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:

| Sr. No | Learning Objective                                                                                       | Cognitive Level | Action Verb |
| :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------- | :---------: |
| 1.     | User will be able to: <br>recall the basics of Classes and Objects                                       | Recall          |  Identify   |
| 2.     | User will be able to: <br>Understand the concepts of objects and classes in Python Programming           | Understand      |  Describe   |
| 3.     | User will be able to: <br>implement/use arithmetic operators on input values in Python programs.         | Apply           |  Implement  |
| 4.     | User will be able to: <br>take the assignment to evaluate what they learnt and enhance his capabilities. | Analyze         |   Examine   |

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

The simulator tab would allow:<br> <br>

<dd> 1. The setup consists of a simulator that helps in performing problems related to class and object with the use of python interpreter.<br>
2. 	Additionally, there will be three sections to work upon: Input Section, Code Section and Output Section.<br>
3. 	The code section will display the python code for the type of operation you want to perform.<br>
4. 	Once the experiment has been performed, you can take the quiz.

</dd>

##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

Assessment Questions:<br>

<dd><b> 1. 1.	A variable that can be shared by each and every object of the class.<br>
a.	Class Variable<br>
b.	Instance Variable<br>
c.	Method Variable<br>
d.	None of the Above<br></dd><br></b><br>
<dd><b>2.	Objects is an instance of class which stores variables and functions?<br>
a.	True<br>
b.	False<br>
c.	Maybe<br>
d.	None of the Above
<br><br></b>
<dd>
<b> 3.  What is the syntax to define class objects :<br>
a)	Object_name.class_name()<br>
b)Object_name.class_name[]<br>
c)Object_name.class_name{}<br>
d)	None of the Above<br></b>
</dd>

##### 2.6 Conclusion:

<dd>The python interpreter has a number of operations involving objects and classes.Python programming language provides an objective to learn about the classes and objects with the help of a simple program and to implement it in Python programming language.
</dd>
