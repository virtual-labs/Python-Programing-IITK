## Round 2

Experiment 5: String

### 1. Story Outline:

<div align="justify"> Here, the experiment involves the use of python simulator implementing String related operartions. A string is usually a bit of text in programming that is written to be displayed to users. It is known to Python when you want to display a string. This is because programmers use either double quote " or single quote ' to enclose a word or group of words to express a string. This concept can be countered with the help of python simulator that provides a friendly programming environment to the beginners; so that every new user can easily perform string related operations .

### 2. Story:

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
<h2>Construction of the set-up</h2>
For better visualization, the simulator is divided into three sections: 
➢	Input Section: Helps in interacting with the user (accepting numbers as inputs).<br>
➢	Code Section: Displays the subsequent code for each type of choice the user takes to perform any operation.<br>
➢	Output Section: Displays the output that will be generated after the code runs successfully.
<br>


#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>understand the basics of strings used in python programming. | Understand | Describe
2.| User will be able to: <br>learn about the various string manipulations that are allowed in Python programming language. | Understand| Describe
3.| User will be able to: <br>enter the values that can be operated upon using strings. | Apply | Implement
4.| User will be able to: <br>generate the desired output of the previous inputs. | Analyze| Examine

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

The simulator tab would allow:<br> <br>
<dd>1. The setup consists of a simulator that helps in performing problems related to string with the use of python interpreter. <br>
2.	Additionally, there will be three sections to work upon: Input Section, Code Section and Output Section.<br>
3.	The code section will display the python code for the type of operation you want to perform.<br>
4.	Once the experiment has been performed, you can take the quiz.<br>

##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

Assessment Questions:<br>

<dd><b> 1.	What  are immutable?<br>
a.	String<br>
b.	List<br>
c.	Dictionary<br>
d.	None of the above<br></dd><br></b><br>
<dd><b>2.	Which of the following can be an example of string?<br>
a.	"123"<br>
b.	"abc"<br>
c.	'abc'<br>
d.	Both b & c<br>
<br><br></b>
<dd>
<b> 3.	What will be the output of k*5 :<br>
a.  kkkkk<br>
b.	k<br>
    k<br>
    k<br>
    k<br>
    k<br>
c.	Error<br>
d.  None of the above<br>
<br></b>
</dd>


##### 2.6 Conclusion:
<dd>The python interpreter has a number of operations involving strings. . Python programming language provides you many operations that can be performed on a string like concatenation, slicing, multiplication etc.
