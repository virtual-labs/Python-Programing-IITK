#### 1.1 Focus Area :
1. Reinforce theoretical concept
2. Instrumentation and Practical Skills

#### 1.2 About the Experiment

<br/>1. To teach the various operations of String in python using an interactive simulator.
<br/>2. The purpose of the Virtual lab is to create interest in students to conduct new experiments in various disciplines.
<br/>3. With the help of our virtual lab, students get a chance to learn different aspects of Python programming language by getting to understand the concepts of Strings in python .
<br/>4. There might be some users who have a problem of understanding the use of Strings with just the theory in hand. With the simulator, it becomes easy to understand.

#### 1.3 Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level

Sr No. |  LO ID |    Learning Objective  | Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| 615 | Student will be able to Student will be able to list the concepts of String in Python programming language. | Recall	| Define
2.| 616 | Student will be able to describe the concepts of String and its operation in Python programming language. | Understand | Describe
3.| 617 | Student will be able to apply the concept of string and perform the operation on String in Python programs. | Apply | Apply

#### 2. Instructional Strategy

Method  | Assessment | Instructional Strategy
:--|:--|:-:
Summative Assessment | · The main objective to develop this lab is to provide an interactive source of learn-ing for the students. The simulation that we provide ful lls our purpose.<br>· The learner will be easily able to understand Python programming language.<br>· The user will able to understand the use of String and its operation in Python pro-gramming language.<br>· With the help of our virtual lab, students get a chance to learn Python program-ming language as they are provided with an interactive simulator. It is bene cial in understanding the basics of String and its operation which simply cannot be under-stood by self- evaluation.	| Problem Based
