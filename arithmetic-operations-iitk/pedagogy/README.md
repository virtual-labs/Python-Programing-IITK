#### 1.1 Focus Area : 
Sr No. |  Focus Area
:--|:--|
1. | Reinforce theoretical concept
2. | Instrumentation and Practical Skills

#### 1.2 About the Experiment
<br/>
. To teach the basics of arithmetic operations using an interactive simulator.<br>
. The purpose of the Virtual lab is to create interest in students to conduct new experiments in various disciplines.<br>
. With the help of our virtual lab, students get a chance to learn different aspects of Python programming language by getting to understand the concepts of arithmetic operations.<br>
. There might be some users who have a problem of understanding the use of arithmetic operations with just the theory in hand. With the simulator, it becomes easy to understand.<br>


#### 1.3 Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr No. |  LO ID |    Learning Objective  | Cognitive Level | Action Verb

<h3> 2 Instructional Strategy</h3>

Method  | Assessment | Instructional Strategy
:--|:--|:-:
Summative Assessment | There are various operators used in the python programming language. We have presented a few most commonly used oerators and presented them in our simulators. Users can try these operators to learn various concepts of Arithematic operators. | Problem
