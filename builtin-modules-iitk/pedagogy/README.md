#### 1.1 Focus Area :
<br>1. Reinforce theoretical concept
2. Instrumentation and Practical Skills


#### 1.2 About the Experiment

<br/>1. • To teach the basics of built-in modules using an interactive simulator.
<br/>2. The purpose of the Virtual lab is to create interest in students to conduct new experiments in various disciplines.
<br/>3. • With the help of our virtual lab, students get a chance to learn different aspects of Python programming language by getting to understand the concepts of built-in modules.
<br/>4. • There might be some users who have a problem of understanding the use of built-in modules with just the theory in hand. With the simulator, it becomes easy to understand.

#### 1.3 Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level

Sr No. |  LO ID |    Learning Objective  | Cognitive Level | Action Verb

<h3> 2 Instructional Strategy</h3>

Method  | Assessment | Instructional Strategy
:--|:--|:-:
Summative Assessment | · The main objective to develop this lab is to provide an interactive source of learn-ing for the students.<br>The simulation that we provide fullls our purpose.<br>· The learner will be easily able to understand Python programming language.<br>· The user will able to understand the use of built- in modules.<br>· With the help of our virtual lab, students get a chance to learn Python program-ming language as they are provided with an interactive simulator. It is benecial in understanding the basics of built-in modules which simply cannot be understood by self- evaluation.	| Problem Based
