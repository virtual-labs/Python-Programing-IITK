### <b>Theory</b>
The execution of programming language codes is done by a compiler. A compiler is given a set of codes or rather a sequence of codes that perform a desired task. The task may or may not be repetitive but the compiler is smart enough to process it.Such repetitive code is known as a 'loop'.<br>
Loop is a sequential set of instructions which gets executed multiple times to reduce minimize the repetition of code.<br>
In Python, we have two types of loops :<br>
i. for loop<br>
ii. while loop<br>

To understand the functioning and flow of a loop, you must get familiar with the term 'block'. A block is the smallest unit in a loop which performs one particular task.<br>
<b>'For' loop :</b><br>
Syntax : for object in range(initialization, limit, update ):
<br>statements<br>
The above given syntax is of for loop where we put the object name after 'for' and the limit inside 'range( )'.<br>
Example : for a in range(4):<br>
print(a)<br>
Output : 0, 1, 2, 3, 4<br>
<b>'While' loop :</b><br>
Syntax : while expression:<br>
statements<br>
The above statement is for while loop, where the testing condition is placed after while and it is followed by the statements placed in the loop body.<br>
Example : while a < 5:<br>
print(a)<br>
Output : 0, 1, 2, 3, 4<br>
