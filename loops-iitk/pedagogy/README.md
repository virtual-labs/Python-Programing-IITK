#### 1.1 Focus Area : 
Sr No. |  Focus Area
:--|:--|
1. | Reinforce theoretical concept


#### 1.2 About the Experiment

<br/>1. To teach the basics of loops using an interactive simulator.
<br/>2. The purpose of the Virtual lab is to create interest in students to conduct new experiments in various disciplines.
<br/>3. With the help of our virtual lab, students get a chance to learn different aspects of Python programming language by getting to understand the concepts of built-in modules. .
<br/>4. There might be some users who have a problem of understanding the use of loops with just the theory in hand. With the simulator, it becomes easy to understand.

#### 1.3 Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr No. |  LO ID |    Learning Objective  | Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| 607 | Student will be able to define the types of looping control structures in Python programming language | Recall | Define
2.| 608 | Student will be able to describe the concepts of loops in Python programming language. | Understand| Describe
3.| 609 | Student will be able to apply loops in various Python programs. | Apply | Apply

<h3> 2 Instructional Strategy</h3>

Method  | Assessment | Instructional Strategy
:--|:--|:-:
| Summative Assessment.| 1. The main objective to develop this lab is to provide an interactive source of learning for the students. The simulation that we provide fulfills our purpose.<br> 2. The learner will be easily able to understand Python programming language.<br>3. The user will able to understand the use of loops <br>4. With the help of our virtual lab, students get a chance to learn Python programming language as they are provided with an interactive simulator. It is beneficial in understanding the basics of loops which simply cannot be understood by self-evaluation. | Problem Based

#### 3 Task & Assessment Questions:
<br>

LO ID |    Learning Objective  | Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
607 | Student will be able to define the types of looping control structures in Python programming language | To State the use of loops. | What are loops?
608 | Student will be able to describe the concepts of loops in Python programming language. | To understand the use of loops | Why are loops used?
609 | Student will be able to apply loops in various Python programs. | To apply/use loops in various Python programs | What is the use of class keyword?
610 | | to evaluate his knowledge on the basis of quiz questions |  In quiz section there are 3 levels to which user can attempt according to the time he have given in experiment to analyze and learn from it.
