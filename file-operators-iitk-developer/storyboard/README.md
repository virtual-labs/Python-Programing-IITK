## Round 2

Experiment 9 : File Operators

### 1. Story Outline:

<div align="justify"> The experiment involves the use of a simulator which is equivalent to a python interpreter. Learning a programming language all by one-self can be difficult job to accomplish. This difficulty can be countered with the help of a simulator that provides a beginner friendly programming environment, so that every new user can easily understand about file operators and can implement in various python programs.

### 2. Story:

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:

<h2>Construction of the Set-up</h2>

For better visualization, a simulator is divided into three aections. <br>
➢ Input Section: Helps in interacting with the user (accepting numbers as inputs).<br>
➢ Code Section: Displays the subsequent code for each type of choice the user takes to perform any operation.<br>
➢ Output Section: Displays the output that will be generated after the code runs successfully.

#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:

| Sr. No | Learning Objective                                                                                       | Cognitive Level | Action Verb |
| :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------- | :---------: |
| 1.     | User will be able to: <br>recall the basics of File Operators                                            | Recall          |  Identify   |
| 2.     | User will be able to: <br>Understand the concepts of file operators in Python Programming                | Understand      |  Describe   |
| 3.     | User will be able to: <br>Understand a code for file operators                                           | Understand      |  Implement  |
| 4.     | User will be able to: <br>take the assignment to evaluate what they learnt and enhance his capabilities. | Analyze         |   Examine   |

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

The simulator tab would allow:<br> <br>

<dd> 1.1.	The set-up consist of a simulator that replicates the use of a python interpreter.<br>
2. 	2.	Additionally there will be three sections to work upon. Input section, code section and output section.<br>
3. 	3.	The code section will display the python code demonstrating file handling.<br>
4. 	Once the experiment has been performed, you can take the quiz.

</dd>

##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

Assessment Questions:<br>

<dd><b> 1. 1.	1.	Which of these is not a file opening mode?<br>
a.	Read<br>
b.	Write<br>
c.	Append<br>
d.	None of the Above<br></dd><br></b><br>
<dd><b>2.	2.	Can a file be created using Write opening mode?<br>
a.	Yes<br>
b.	No<br>
c.	Maybe<br>
d.	None of the Above
<br><br></b>
<dd>
<b> 3.  What is the syntax to define class objects :<br>
a)	Yes<br>
b)	No<br>
c)	Maybe<br>
d)	None of these<br></b>
</dd>

##### 2.6 Conclusion:

<dd>The Python language supports file handling and has a number of file operators. They can be used to either create, read, write or append a file. Thus, it makes it easier for a programmer to handle files directly by writing a code in Python.
