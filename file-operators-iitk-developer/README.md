<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

Python Programming Lab help user to understand basic concept of python programming and also will help student to learn the basic syntaxes of python programming.  


<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>
In this experiment student will understand about file handling concept in python. File handling allows users to handle files i.e., to read and write files, along with many other file handling options, to operate on files.
Python treats file differently as text or binary. Each line of code includes a sequence of characters and they form text file. 
Each line of a file is terminated with a special character, called the EOL or End of Line characters like comma {,} or newline character. 
It ends the current line and tells the interpreter a new one has begun.
