#### 1.1 Focus Area :
Instrumentation and Practical Skills

#### 1.2 About the Experiment
<br/>
. To teach the basics of File Operation using an interactive simulator.<br>
. The purpose of the Virtual lab is to create interest in students to conduct new exper-iments in various disciplines.<br>
. With the help of our virtual lab, students get a chance to learn different aspects of Python programming language by getting to understand the concepts of File Opera-tion.<br>
. There might be some users who have a problem of understanding the use of File Operation with just the theory in hand. With the simulator, it becomes easy to un-derstand.<br>


#### 1.3 Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr No. |  LO ID |    Learning Objective  | Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| 599 | Student will be able to recall the concepts of File Operation in Python programming language.<br> | Understand	| Describe 
2.| 600 | Student will be able to understand the concepts of File Operation in Python programming language. | Understand | Describe
3.| 601 | Student will be able to implement/use File Operation is various Python programs. | Apply | Solve
4.| 602 | Student will be able to take the quiz for self-evaluation and enhance his capabilities. | Evaluate | Conclude

:--|:--|:-:
Summative Assessment | · The main objective to develop this lab is to provide an interactive source of learning for the students. The simulation that we provide fullls our purpose.<br>· The learner will be easily able to understand Python programming language.<br>· The user will able to understand the use of built- in functions.<br>· With the help of our virtual lab, students get a chance to learn Python programming language as they are provided with an interactive simulator. It is benecial in understanding the basics of File Operation which simply cannot be understood by self-evaluation.	| Problem Based
